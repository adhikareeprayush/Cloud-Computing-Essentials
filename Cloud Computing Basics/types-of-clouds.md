## ‚òÅÔ∏è Major Cloud Types ‚òÅÔ∏è

As defined by technology markets and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), there are three major cloud service models:

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

### üì± Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers applications over the internet that you can rent and use directly online.

**SaaS replaces traditional enterprise applications such as CRMs (Customer Relationship Management) and ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning).**

**Examples**: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace

### üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides storage, computing, and other infrastructure services that you can leverage from local or remote resources.

**IaaS is designed to replace your data center, including storage and compute services.**

**Examples**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud

### üöÄ Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS offers application development, testing, and deployment services available on demand.

**PaaS is a cloud-based version of application deployment and hosting.**

**Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine

Each cloud service model offers unique benefits and caters to different needs, from renting ready-to-use applications to developing and deploying your own applications in the cloud.
